# a string with paranthesis() is well bracketed if all paranthesis are matched is every opening bracket has matching closing bracket and vice versa.
#Write a python program having function wellbrackered(s) that takes string a containing parenthesis and return true if s is well bracketed else false
# bracketed else false.

# Hint: Keep track of nesting depth of bracket. Initially the depth is 0.depth is 0.
#The depth increases with each opening bracket and decreases with each closing bracket.wHAT ARE THE CONSTRAINTS on the value of nesting depth to the wellbracket?

# example: wellbracket("20"))
# false

# wellbracketed"(a+b)(a+b)"
# true
